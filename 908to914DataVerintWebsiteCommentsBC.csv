Very Satisfied,"So easy to place your order especially if you have the item numbers ready. However, I didn't see the box to order my free book and my order is above $50. Please contact me. Thank you.",
Satisfied,"Was not able to order desired item due to low quantities.  Daniel (Scholastic rep) checked and said Scholastic was out of ""Who Would Win?"" Ultimate Rumble 6 pack 40C1 and when I asked if I could pre-pay he checked and said it was doubtful there would be more coming in.",
Very Satisfied,We love the variety and cost of books offered.  We love being able to earn bonus points too!,
Very Disappointed,"Created an ewallet and added funds for book fair, clicked the link to print it and it gave me a blank page. No way to get back to the ewallet page after that and no mention of it in our account. Called and spoke to a rep that confirmed the ewallet was created and the funds from our scholastic gift card were applied, still nothing showing on the site under our account or any scholastic page I can find. Sent my 8 year old to school crying because he doesn’t think he will be able to buy anything without the paper with a barcode on it.",
Very Satisfied,I would like for you to bring back the dollar books.,
Neutral,Bouncing between parent purchases and purchases that support teachers.,

Very Satisfied,"Would like to see a bigger collection of popular books. But other than that, everything was great.",
Very Satisfied,Many of my students ordered books this month.  The deals were good!,
Neutral,"Bonus point display on order play is not obvious. I had to go to my account to see bonus points. On order page, it appears to me, I have no bonus points. On my teacher page, it indicates 466 bonus points. Confusing!",
Satisfied,Some of the codes of the books in the flyers did not match when entering the codes online. But looking at the titles I found the books.  I Will place my order tomorrow.,

Disappointed,Difficult to get through,
Satisfied,it is frustrating that i am unable to view pricing prior to connecting to a teacher,
Very Satisfied,Different times when placing an order I have tried to search for a specific book title and am unable to find it.  I have used both the title and a number that I have seen listed as being the specific book.  Without searching through all the titles how do I find it?  When doing my order tonight I was searching for the book titled … The Day I Forgot To Wash My Hands.  I again was unable to find it.,
Neutral,the site is a bit difficult to navigate,
Very Satisfied,I will place my order next week (2 week timeline for my students),
Very Satisfied,I think I get more excited than my child about book orders. Scholastic always has great choices and our home library is bursting at the seams!,

Very Disappointed,WHY IS THE PLUSH UNICORN NOT AVAILABLE FOR SHIPPING TO THE HOME?????,
Very Satisfied,need an app this titles look pretty good,
Very Disappointed,I have been trying to order books all evening and they will not add to my cart for purchase. This is very frustrating as we were supposed to have through today (9/12) to order.  I would like to still place my order but do not know how to do so.,
Satisfied,Did not complete today because I need to call customer service to see if I can order more.  I want to give one to each of our 150 students,
Satisfied,"When I first tried to access the book, it would not load.  I logged back in",
Very Satisfied,SMA order,
Disappointed,the instructions we were given to order a book was NOT how it was presented on the site.  should not be that difficult to order a $2 book!,
Very Satisfied,I appreciate the $1 books so I can purchase books to give to my students each month.,
Satisfied,Hard to understand the free book up to $5. I wasn't sure if it would be be a discount of $5 for the total order (I was interested in a $7 book to put towards the $5 free) or if I had to choose a book that was $5 or under,
Satisfied,"Logging in was difficult, I had to use the live chat today for assistance and change my password",

Satisfied,I was trying to set up and edit my online letter and could not close out,
Neutral,"Great selection of books, website each to navigate.",

Satisfied,Thank you for shipping faster!,
Neutral,"I received an email for the third time this month that says ACTION REQUIRED A student has ordered online and you must submit it now....  I notice when I submit each order I do not receive BONuS points. Each order has been over $20, but I just get 20 bonus points. Why don't you combine all of mine for each month and I can receive the EXTRA bonus points?  An order of $60 triples my amount of BPs! How can I get the maximum amount?",
Very Satisfied,Scholastic is a great company! My class loves to read. I'm hoping many of them will order books this year.,
Very Disappointed,"Every time I attempt to use this site I feel massively frustrated. As a parent, there are multiple sites you can (attempt to) order from, and I went through the whole process of filling up a cart before realizing it was the wrong site. It's really inefficient that I can't connect to a bookclub at checkout. I do this every school year first thing, and then I tend to give up ordering because it pisses me off so much.",
Neutral,It would be nice to be able to search under subject/interests and get more than like 8 choices.,
Neutral,I also hesitate to order from scholastic because the last few times it took like 3 months for the money to be processed and get my books. It's really irritating. I only tried again to help support our teacher.,

Satisfied,When I tried to delete the third book down it deleted the first book,
Satisfied,why do we pay tax online but not directly to the school?,

Very Satisfied,Very user friendly set up and i love that you can just put the codes in and dont have to try to find the numbers or books yourself.,
Neutral, The selection of books was not that great today. My son preferred books from amazon.,
Neutral,We had a hard time updating my childs teacher for the year but were able to figure it out.,
Neutral,Site flyers slow to load,
Very Satisfied,Thank you for the great program to get books in the hands of my students.,
Very Satisfied,"I have been ordering from Scholastic for many years now. Last year, the shipping delays were frustrating and made parents hesitant to place future orders.  I look forward to reasonable shipping times and ordering great books this year!",
Very Satisfied,Great site!!,
Neutral,"I wish I could have search results sorted into ""all"" instead of pages and pages I have to keep clicking next on. An endless scroll would be nice (the kind that refreshes and pops up more results until you get to the bottom of all of them). I love the search filters that let me choose a price range.",
Neutral,"I have been ordering from scholastic for the last 2 years. I always get confused by the many ""ways"" you can order. Book Club? As a Parent? For the school? I love Scholastic, please don't get me wrong, but I wish the site were a little more user friendly.",
Satisfied,It is harder to order for my own child when I also have a teacher account.,
Very Disappointed,"I was going to place an online order with my phone because I was traveling, but it never showed me how to ""pick a pack""",
Very Disappointed,it never showed me  my $10 to spend right now.  What's going on with that?,
Very Satisfied,I have used Scholastic as a teacher and a parent. I love the selection and good prices.,
Neutral,"While trying to look up the second book I was taken back to the first book I looked for and it was added a second time to my account.  I was unable to find the book I was looking for, only placed a small order through the website.  I will place the full order through the order form.",
Very Satisfied,"First year joining Scholastic book club and off to a great start, user friendly and affordable book deals.",
Very Satisfied,I love  Scholastic Book Clubs!,
Very Satisfied,When a parent orders online I get an email to go in and approve the purchase. Should I not do that until my due date so that my order is as big as it can be? It seems doing it as they come in separates out the order and makes my total less.,
Satisfied,I had to reset my password and login in a few times. I wished there was an option once you reset your password to login directly rather than having to log in again. And the drop-down menu was difficult to click as it disappeared once I tried to mouse over any item in the list.,
Satisfied,"I also wasn't sure if I was shopping for my child's class or not. I'm still not entirely sure when my purchase applies towards the teacher. (Do I have to go through the Book Club or can I just go through the regular shop?) With a bit more looking, I think I'll figure it out but it was a bit confusing at first glance!",
Satisfied,I did find the reading level filters unfamiliar as they seemed more for teachers than parents.,
Very Satisfied,I love Scholastic Books,
Satisfied,i like it,
Very Satisfied,I loved using a promo code and getting  a free book!,
Satisfied,"Lost out on points from previous teacher.  She is gone so we lost her points, bummer.",

Very Satisfied,Added to my order but not submitting it until Friday.,
Neutral,"give  to add to cart w hover, and only add to list or ""more like this""",
Satisfied,I am just not quite sure how to order via the teacher portal.,
Satisfied,"I love ordering from your website, but it can be difficult to navigate between the Parent, Teacher, Kid sites. In my opinion it could be more streamlined.",
Satisfied,"I do not understand why you have to clean out the classroom wishlist??? Unless the book was acquired,  a person would still want it on their wishlist.   I also do not understand WHY you would clear out the class recommendations because those would not change unless the teacher changed grades. It is beyond frustrating that I  have to redo those list every year! It is at a point that I do not even like using those list! PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!",
Neutral,I wish you could send stickers with the Class Codes on them... like in the past.,
Very Satisfied,Live Chat very helpful and effective/effiicient,
Very Satisfied,Very easy to use for a new teacher.  I've always loved scholastic!,
Disappointed,Really sad that I will not be using scholastic again this year due to the $25 minimum free shipping charge. Teachers should not have to pay because not all parents are able to purchase books. We should not have to pay out of pocket or deny students that actually want to buy books because not a lot of classmates parents allow them to.,
Satisfied,I'm not a big fan of having that pop up every time I add something to the cart.  Yikes.  That gets frustrating fast.,
Very Satisfied,I found exactly what my daughter wanted and some more books we may get in the future! I was never able to afford books at the book fair and I want my daughter to have a great experience! Thanks!,
Very Satisfied,I my order qualified for a free book. Awesome,
Satisfied,Ever time I clicked on enter orders it went away before I could click on anything in the drop down menu.,
Satisfied,I wish we would get notifications when a parent places an order online,

Satisfied,Just wish you would keep me posted on technology I ordered.,
Neutral,It asked if I would be willing to do a survey when I’m finished but it came up immediately. I had only begun to order! Very frustrating!,
Very Satisfied,"I have been trying to get catalogs sent to my school for my class for about a year, and I haven't received anything.",
Very Satisfied,Thank  you for making it easy to order books for my grandchildren.,
Very Satisfied,5 in recommendations only because everyone I work with already has Scholastic.  :),
Satisfied,i would love to be able to buy single books that are offered in the packages.,
Very Satisfied,Just started my order today. Will finish up and submit Thursday if any more orders come in.,
Neutral,The website was viewed from my iPhone X and it isn’t very user friendly. I could barely zoom out and access certain buttons because it was zoomed in. I’m very tech savvy and was able to figure it out eventually. But this was frustrating.,
Neutral,I had a difficult time finding my class code.,
Very Satisfied,Great site.  Thank you for increasing the bonus point amount on many things.,
Very Satisfied,"Wasn't sure how to complete the free $5 book offer for orders over $25. Called Scholastic. Received excellent help right away, thank you!",
Neutral,I hope shipping is faster than last year.,
Neutral,"I'm not using the online ordering feature this year because Scholastic didn't run credit cards in a timely manner last year and I ended up paying for students orders.  This was Scholastics fault for not running the cards for months, but I'm the one who paid for it.",
Satisfied,"Not really, but with the READS promotion it would be nice just to get a $5.00 discount on any book if it's more than $5.00 to purchase.   At least I could buy a book I want verses getting something my child may not want.  Please consider this as a future option.",
Very Satisfied,Thanks for being a great resource for materials.,
Very Satisfied,I wanted to order a book but unfortunately it was out of stock,
Very Satisfied,It says I have an outstanding balance. I asked the bookkeeper and she said she can't get an invoice from you to pay it.  That would be my only negative.,
Very Satisfied,Figuring out how to get the free book,
Neutral,I wish I could have easily seen the due date for my granddaughter's class so I would have a better idea of the timing involved in getting the books I ordered.,
Very Disappointed,garbage literature.  no classics.,
Very Satisfied,Site was easy enough.  The one suggestion I would have is to be able to change the relationship to the child in the classroom when creating an account.  It only states Parent.  I am not the parent but the grandparent then my sister who will also be creating an account and placing an order is the Aunt.  That's it and thank you!,
Satisfied,I was going to submit an order but the survey came up first.,
Very Satisfied,I used to have an account and my email didnt work anymore had to create a new one.,
Disappointed,"I've been off my account for two years due to a change into virtual setting and now I'm having the hardest time getting back in. I reset my password - after trying to 4 different times - and now can't get into set the due date for the order, as it seems I keep getting put into the parent section rather than educator section, then keep circling back in. I'm frustrated already and haven't even started placing orders or sending out club info to families yet.",
Very Satisfied,Awesome as usual!,
Disappointed,"I was surprised to see more book options in the ""Select the free $5 book"" section than in the regular website. For example, we saw 5 times as many Fly Guy books on that list than on the scrolling carousels. I would prefer a list view instead of the carousels. I would also like to know I'm viewing all the options.",
Satisfied,i was not able to get my free book. i order more than $27 and i was not able to get the $5 book.,
Neutral,Where are the PAPER reminders to PRINT for parents for us to send out with our PAPER FLYERS that you send ever month?  I do not like giving out my parents email addresses to websites as I feel it violates their privacy.  I like to attach a reminder to the top of the paper flyers that go home.  I am disappointed that you have removed that feature.,
Very Satisfied,Love the site!,
Satisfied,Out of stock item,
Very Satisfied,Glad shipping is supposed to be back on track  :),
Satisfied,It wasn't super clear how to connect to my kid's classroom. I would make that a little easier to find....,
Neutral,"The website is a little difficult to navigate to order books. I am trying to find the order status but can't find the order. I clicked on the link for ""check order status"" and it is not being shown.",
Very Satisfied,"It took me a bit to find the ""switch to parent"" account button, as I also have an educator account-but once I found it I was THRILLED! Thank you for making this an option so that I can support my child's teacher and also continue to use my educator account!",
Neutral,The pop ups highlighting certain books was distracting. The overall site navigation feels disjointed.,
Satisfied,Should be easier to find where to connect to a teacher as the child progresses through grades and changes teachers,
Satisfied,"The prices are high compared to Amazon which is disappointing and makes it harder to purchase books here when I can get the same book for $5 less on Amazon. (Dog Man, and Cat Kid Comic club books specifically.)",
Very Satisfied,I would love it if you all can put out more Club Leo flyers not just twice a year. My students really enjoy ordering but are unable to because there are no flyers for every month for Club Leo or Bilingual books.,
Satisfied,"The filters seem to really limit the options! But honestly it's fine. Just happy Scholastic does this - remember the book fairs? Do you guys still do those? My dad would give me a $20 and I felt like a KING on book fair day. Bring those back, man!",
Satisfied,checking out multiple  books for different grade levels... it was a struggle at first.,
Satisfied,Hard time finding the books from the flyer.  I type it into the section on the homepage that says code from flyer but when I hit enter nothing happens.  Sometime hard to find stuff,
Satisfied,Was unable to change my password because I needed to call to change my account from educator to grandparent.,
Very Satisfied,COuldnt put in coupon code for student,
Satisfied,Unable to find where to order,
Very Satisfied,Easy to use site!,
Satisfied,It took a little while to figure out how to get started when I had a class code.,
Satisfied,"It was very easy this year. It was difficult last year, i am happy with it.",
Satisfied,This site is really nice. Please don't change any content of this site. Thank you!,
Neutral,"If one hovers over an item for too long, the item automatically enlarged, and it required an extra step to close it out. That was annoying. it work, but it was annoying.",
Very Satisfied,I didn't see where I would get the $10.00 right now.  Is this add for the parent? It looked like it was for teacher.,
Very Satisfied,this was very easy,
Disappointed,I don’t want to limit my choices based on the child’s age. I would enjoy just scrolling through the books. The newsletters are hard to read on a phone.,
Satisfied,so far so good.  let's see how delivery goes.,
Very Disappointed,"This site is ridiculous, love to participate in  book events and allow child freedom to choose own books of interest. However,  your site is not user friendly to additional funds to an already existing account. User FAQ is not helpful, nor is there a shortcut or specific menu button offered to stream line easy method of payment. Completely annoyed so difficult to find account information to update school and fair information, site continues to route you back in circles! Lover of reading and books, extremely frustrated with website.",
Satisfied,I wish it was easier to locate items other than books in the teacher store.,
Very Satisfied,Great!,

Very Satisfied,The bonus points which allow me to buy books for our classroom is an incredible blessing!!!,
Neutral,Just looking for specific books and they were not available.,
Neutral,can not order in apple phone,
Satisfied,I decided to spend some teacher bonus points too. It would be nice to be able to toggle the pages of the bonus points site without going back to the beginning to change from type to type. Like technology to math and stem.,
Very Satisfied,Makes ordering much easier!!!,
Disappointed,I wish the site could keep a list of books I already bought.  I mean I have an account why can't it remember something like that .,
Satisfied,Very user friendly.  I love how parents can order online.,
Neutral,"Our preschool is not getting the SeeSaw flyers we need for out students.  Where can I order them?  Thank you, Valinda Barkley",
Very Satisfied,Nice Experience !!,
Very Satisfied,I had missing books from my order and did a live chat. Jeffery was wonderful and solved the problem right away.  Other teachers at my school site saw my Scholastic box and asked if it took a long time to get my order - I let them know it was quick and they were very excited to put in orders.,
Neutral,I can't find the teacher's recommendations.,
Very Satisfied,"I do think it's a shame they don't do the book fairs like we had when I was a kid, but this is a great site, well designed and works great. Good job to your web developers!",
Very Satisfied,It is so good to be back ordering!  The past 2 years have been awful!,
Very Satisfied,I purposely ordered over $25 to get the free book but the code that the teacher gave and the website shares says it’s expired so I didn’t get my free $5 book. 70097915,
Neutral,I was looking for my younger daughter and now my older daughter wants to add books.,
Very Satisfied,Thank you!,
Disappointed,"The website states that with $25 you can use the code READS for a free book pick, up to $5. I have $25 in my cart and each time I attempt to enter the code READS there's an error box that says the code has expired.",
Disappointed,There needs to be an easier way to see a teacher's wish list and order from there.  It would be so nice to be able to connect to the teacher's wish list and buy a few books from there.  It is not currently user friendly.,
Very Satisfied,"Easy to use website, no issues or errors, smooth experience.",
Satisfied,It would be nice if you could enter items for wishlist and teacher recommendations directly from the flyer page. It is hard to go back and forth from flyer page to order list.,
Neutral,Trouble finding my dashboard,
Very Satisfied,"I appreciate the ease of navigating the scholastic site.  I can easily find the books we are looking for, and I appreciate it is linked to PayPal.",
Satisfied,"I wish I could buy hardback books.  I'd prefer them, and don't mind the additional costs,",
Satisfied,The prices have gone up. There is no discount for ordering online and there is tax. Where is the benefit of ordering online?,

Very Satisfied,n/a,
Very Satisfied,No feedback.,
Very Satisfied,I like the books,
Satisfied,I was not aware that I couldn't submit student's checks so I had to use my credit card.,
Very Satisfied,"The difficulty I had was when I attempted to refer a friend and it would not accept her email.  I do have one question also.  I wanted to earn the extra 250 bonus points but didn't want to put off ordering, but I would love to see if it's possible.  Her email is: hoschsz@scps.k12.fl.us",

Very Satisfied,I love Scholastic! Thank you for helping me fill my library with books! :),

Very Satisfied,great books at good prices,
Very Satisfied,There have been EXTENSIVE shipping delays. This has become such an issue that I haven't ordered from Scholastic in almost a year. Please fix.,
Neutral,"I would much prefer if the teacher had taken my check and not told my child I HAVE to order it on line.  I don't need yet another account and more of my information being shared out.  If this is the route that I am being told I must use, they flyer that comes home should not say to ""Make checks payable to...""",
Neutral,"The pop up to create an account was over the flyer window. The pop ups prevented me from selecting the right year for my daughter's birth from the drop down. If the pop up is active, perhaps there's a way to disable the flyer pop ups.",
Neutral,So easy to find books with the code in the Book Order Form from school.  Glad it was easy to find my teacher too.  I remember the excitement of when book orders came in at school.  Glad my kids can experience the simple joys too - and so easily on my end.,

Neutral,"It's great you have value packs, but when we have two or more of the books in the pack already, it's not a value. It would be great if the books could also be bought separately.",

Very Satisfied,I love Scholastic Books!,
Satisfied,Ordering soon,
Neutral,I don’t think your website is as intuitive as it use to be. I have to long in a few times to actually get to where I want to be now. I use to login once and  everything was right there. I also have a subscription to the magazine for my class but my acc Says I don’t have any subscriptions. I have to login somewhere else to get to that. Not sure why this has changed but it is very frustrating for me. And I have been doing class orders for several years (with a few years off in the middle of that),
Very Satisfied,Thank you!,
Neutral,"There was slight confusion as the scholastic site wasn't recognizing the codes, then an agent directed me toward club.scholastic and it worked fine.  Thanks, didn't know there was a whole different site.",
Very Disappointed,I could not go check the dollar books I put in for cuz they disappeared too. They were  2 -ducklings and 2 of Bunny will not smile!    If you are going to change things it should be in writing!,
Very Disappointed,"Other, I am a Golden apple  teacher and I did not see the thing  for the 400 bonus pts. You use to send them to  us on a special  paper  I’m upset  that something like this can no longer be done retroactive like it COULD in the past.  Also, when I put my picks for my $10  to spend now kept disappearing  and yes I did confirm them!",

I'm currently a 3K Preschool Teacher who manages the Scholastic Ordering for our  K-5 school and early childhood programs (2K - 4K).  Is it possible to change my preferences to early childhood selections?,
Neutral,"I was logged in, but to get my funds from a previous carryover, I had to log in again and had multiple windows open.",
Neutral,"Trying to order what I wanted to buy, kept telling me as a teacher I needed to put students orders on another page",
Disappointed,"Not a very good selection of books.  I've gotten free ""Scholastic"" books from little free libraries and I can't find those titles today on the Scholastic website.  I was looking for Beekle, Susan Verde books, Prince & Knight, Todd Parr, Eric Carle, and LGBTQ+ affirming books.",
Satisfied,The printable letter to parents was giving me a bad route. . unable to do that.   ,
Satisfied,I was also wondering if we were going to get fliers to send home with the students?  I have not received any yet.,
Disappointed,i wanted to order several books but trying to get them in the cart was a pain .,
Satisfied,Student could not use code READS because he paid using his own  money. There should be a code that allows students to order without having to use a credit card.,
Very Satisfied,It was so easy,
Very Satisfied,"I started to place my order, but I am not ready to submit yet.  I will in a day or two.",
Neutral,Have a place to donate to teacher's list of specific books they want for their classroom.,
Satisfied,"Needed to register as Grandparent but not listed.  I have used Scholastic many years as teacher, parent, and now Grandparent.  No need to contact me - it would not let me send without it.  Thanks",
Neutral,I like that shipping is free for online orders but do not like that shipping is so expensive for paper orders under $25. That means I have to turn students away or use my own money for shipping.,
Very Satisfied,"GOOD SELECTION, AND GOT THE BOOKS THAT ADALYNN WANTED.",
Very Satisfied,I like the updated layout.,
Neutral,I placed an order back in 2021 for $29.00. I got word they were back ordered but then school year ended and we never received that order. So I am reluctant to order again.,
Very Satisfied,I have been a Scholastic bookclub supporter as a classroom teacher since 1992.,
Satisfied,"Greate, easy and user-friendly websites, book arrangements. Many thanks",
Satisfied,Need more $1 books.,
Very Satisfied,I found it difficult to find the teacher code to get the update teacher into my son's profile.,
Neutral,"i would like to be able to ship them to my home instead of the school. also, it would be nice to have a link to the 5.00 books to make it easier to browse them for the free offers.",
Neutral,It was very difficult to place the order. I thought that it would have been simpler to just use the Fall 2022 brochure.  I had to type the name of the book to add to the cart.,
Satisfied,"No major difficulties, just started shopping on home page when I should have been on the Book Club page...user error, but easily remedied",
Neutral,The website was very easy to use. No complaints here.,
Neutral,I have left over from last bookfair but under a different teacher and there is no where to apply the funds,
Very Satisfied,I love Scholastic book clubs!,
Disappointed,It wasn't very intuitive.   The fact there is a tutorial video to help people navigate demonstrates it wasn't designed well.   I also don't like the fact I must create an account to shop.,
Very Satisfied,Visiting website to add to my wish list.,
Satisfied,Easy to navigate,
Satisfied,locating teacher page,
Neutral,I cannot find where to entre the Teacher and/or Class code.  Everything is quite confusing and nothing like the flyer.  YOU have to completely start over to order.  It is time consuming and not easy.,
Very Satisfied,Site is very easy to use,
Very Satisfied,Site is very easy to use,
Very Disappointed,We can’t edit shipping address to have the books sent to our house. There is no way to edit. Also it is very difficult to view and navigate through the checkout page in general.,
Satisfied,What happened to the 10 book pack for $10?  I bought those every month,
Very Satisfied,I started placing my order and looked at the monthly specials.  I will place an order next week.,
Very Satisfied,"We had so much trouble last year.  I only ordered one time.  Seems like things are back to the way they were.  If my books arrive on time, I will order each month.  Thank you!",
Disappointed,I selected funding the account with a card in error and wanted to use PayPayl - I couldn't find it after selected credit card.,
Very Satisfied,I'm impressed with how easy it wa,
Neutral,"The site is very confusing. I have used Scholastic in the past and so I signed in. But then it took me to just a parent site rather than my child's teacher. I ended up going to ""book club"" which I guess is different and then that worked.",
Satisfied,I was able to connect my child to her current teacher and I also added items to a  wish list.,
Satisfied,"I've not ordered for a while. I continue to get e-mails from scholastic, yet my account was not found.",

Neutral,I love that I am able to order books and put together a wish list for future orders.,

Very Satisfied,My grandson loves getting these books and I enjoy ordering them for him.,
Satisfied,Today things went smoothly. It is not a busy time of day.. sunday at 8pm.  Generally  I find the site to be difficult. The search often can be difficult to find what I need.,

Very Satisfied,This is a wonderful way for parents to order great books for their children.,
Very Satisfied,YAH,
Neutral,Im trying to submit my classroom order but  I believe there was a 10 dollar credit for last month and I can't find it.,
Very Disappointed,"To Whom This May Concern,    I will not pay for the shipping on the last order. If I have to pay almost 7 dollars to have two books shipped then please refund the parent back their money.  This is ridiculous.     Sincerely,  Dissatisfied Educator!",
Neutral,"Where did the 10 for 10$ get to? I am very disappointed that you do not offer that any more or even dollar books for teachers to buy. I teach for Head Start and I like to help my families build their home library by sending a book home a month. Some of my students don't even have books at home. I realize that everything in this world is going up, but my salary isn't really going up. I spend my own money to give the children this book.",

Very Disappointed,Login was very difficult. This site is unfriendly to use with a password managemer.,
Very Disappointed,"I do not know whether it is the internet connectivity, but I was unsuccessful in placing my order online. Nothing seems to be loading when I click on it, and I have tried several times.",
Neutral,"I get very frustrated using the READS code. If there are no appropriate books, Scholastic should simply take $5.00 of the total order.  Also, there periodically should offer codes to parents ho routinely purchase from the Scholastic Book Club.",
Neutral,I wasn't done approving my class order or choosing my books before the survey popped up.,
Very Satisfied,Thank you!,
Very Satisfied,"This was super easy, fast, and efficient.",
Very Satisfied,"I would be more likely to recommend Scholastic if the shipping issues are no longer a problem this year.  I was a longtime supporter, until last year.  Now, I'm hoping for the best.",
Very Satisfied,I love how we could search for the classroom teacher. So easy! Thank you!!!,
Very Satisfied,THE SITE IS NICE,
Satisfied,when I hit submit it froze,
Satisfied,I want to change my class code for this school year.,
Very Satisfied,great books for kids,
Very Satisfied,"I am surprised to see tax being charged for the online orders.  Is that new this year?  Why aren't the cost of the books adjusted to absorb the tax?    Thank you,  Kathy Thomas",
Satisfied,Challenges distinguishing where to place student order vs. teacher order. I  figured it out though.,
Very Satisfied,The online prices used to be .50 cents less than what was printed in the flyer.  I noticed that is no longer the case.,
Satisfied,I picked about 4 or 5 different dollar books for having spent at least $75 and they were all unavailable.  What is the point of offering this if you don't have the books available?,
Very Satisfied,school code error and all other code errors,
Very Disappointed,"Last year my son never received his books. Cayden's teacher and I spent a lot of time trying to resolve the issue. I vowed never to purchase from you again. Since this year Cayden having a teacher that I think of highly, I have decided, for his sake, to give you another try. We will wait to see how this order goes.",
Satisfied,"It's hard to find the monthly rewards this year.  You have to click on a very small ""see all rewards"" tab to find it.",
Very Disappointed,The book our Daughter wants does not have the ADD TO CART button!!!  She is very upset and crying right now!!!  CANNOT FIND TEACHER listed.  Why?,
Very Satisfied,Easy to use and navigate.,
Very Disappointed,"I missed entering the promo code for $5.00 book value and can’t edit order. This was the entire reason I ordered $25 of books. I’ll be less likely to order at all in the future, because these books are available elsewhere.",
Neutral,This survey keeps populating even though I have yet to submit my order.,
Satisfied,Great website and everything this company does. I do wish there was a sort by price option. Its hard times these days.,
Satisfied,Not able to order a book due to lack of inventory,
Very Disappointed,We spent 20 minutes adding to our cart & then the cart expired. Nothing is in the cart & it won’t let me add any items. My son’s name is already connected to his teacher/school but the cart keeps asking me to assign his name to each book (it won’t let me do that either now). Super frustrating. I won’t order again.,
Very Satisfied,The website is easy to use. I'm just hoping my order is shipped and received in a timely manner this year. I only placed one order last year because it took over a month to receive my class/student's books.,
Neutral,Just setting up my account,
Very Satisfied,LOVE Scholastic.  :-),
Neutral,I have previously set up an e-wallet (as a teacher) but could find no information on how to share a link with parents interested in contributing funds.,
Satisfied,"I am disappointed that you have a very limited number of books under $2.00.  Th e book of the week ( The Mouse and the Motorcycle)  was much too difficult for my first grade students..  Please have several book of the week options for different age levels.  Also, I do not think it is fair to require teachers to have an order limit in order to access the book of the week.  Not all families are able to buy books at this time so teachers are often the only way some students are receiving books.  When you limit teachers' access to the book of the week, you limit the kids who really need to get books in their hands!",
Very Satisfied,"I would like additional paper fliers mailed to me at my school for parents who prefer to order books with this method. Thank you! (I teach Young 5's - 4 and 5 year olds.)  Jill Van Eck  Woodbridge Elementary School  9110 Woodbridge  Zeeland, MI. 49464",

Very Satisfied,Website is easy to use,
Satisfied,Please send me flyers appropriate for 6th grade ELA and Social Studies. Florida.,
Satisfied,Would be nice to add a feature to search/sort by price,
Very Satisfied,"I love the ""item finder"" on the main page that allows me to just enter in the item number and it automatically adds it to my cart. Very easy to search and get more details on books.",
Neutral,"Navigation is rough.  Site could be more user friendly.  Pop up for survey is requesting answers to questions that I haven't been given a chance to complete yet.  Ex.  Were you able to complete your task?  (Browse/search for books.). Pop up happened for survey before I checked out.  So no, I was not able to complete this task yet because you are stopping me....not really well thought out there...",
Satisfied,I seem to have different Customer Numbers.  When I am online I see a 7 digit number.  On the back of my catalogues I see a 9 digit number.  I wasn't sure which one to put on my payment stub/envelope when sending in a student check.,
Neutral,I wanted an option to ship to home but could not find it,
Very Satisfied,none,
Very Satisfied,"Quicky, easy and affordable!",
Neutral,"It's hard to navigate the variety of search and browse options- flyers, filters, search box. Specifically I once found items that were requested for the class by the teacher but later could not get back to the list.",
Very Satisfied,Good site to order books for kids.,
Satisfied,I was kicked out of sight and had to go back.,
Satisfied,Love scholastics,
Disappointed,I cannot make an account or purchase books online because I can't find my kid's teacher and I also don't have a class code.  This makes it impossible to order.,
Very Satisfied,"The website is definitely better and easier to use.  I like using the online features.  I didn't do any book orders last year because 2020 was so bad, but I am back on board.",
Neutral,You all have to up your diversity game. Your prices have also gone up (I know that's the economy and out of your hands) to the point that I can't afford to restock my library.,
Very Disappointed,NOT LETTING ME ENTER STUDENT ORDERS,
Satisfied,Multiple fliers unable to load,
Satisfied,"When I log in, I'm immediately taken to the parent side of ordering.  The website timed out while I was verifying my total. I had to log back in.  The student order coupons are smaller. Would it be possible to make the order numbers larger and bolder. The numbers are hard to read.",
Very Satisfied,I had to google how to find my kid's teacher... was guided to book clubs.,
Neutral,Hard to search. Unusual organization of site.,
Disappointed,Don't know how to use the site. Just ended up going to the library.,
Very Satisfied,"The search results for the free book on the checkout screen was not yielding any results, even though one of the books I was searching for was listed. I was forced to utilize the pagination and A-Z sort to find the book instead.",
Satisfied,"I miss not being able to request a different catalog without having to call to request. You have the option listed, but it’s useless since you can’t order them online.",
Very Disappointed,I really am having a difficult time navigating your site. Where are the prices? What is the A.R. level? Ridiculous!,
Neutral,When I was trying to add Teacher wishlist books it kept changing the quantity to my order,
Neutral,"It said that I got $10 in free books, so I ordered two books for a total of $9, but it didn't given them to me free....it's very confusing...so I didn't get $10 of free books, instead, I paid $10 more.",
Satisfied,"It showed my teacher order cost was $16.34, so I chose my credit card for payment and it charged me $52.34. One of my students sent in a check for $36 which I'm going to mail in-but it also charged me for his book order.  I will call Monday about getting a refund.",
Very Satisfied,Very easy to access and use the site.,
Satisfied,I would like to be able to print 2 copies of the letter to parents on one page in order to save paper.,
Neutral,"Coupon code READS says that it is expired when ordering from my parent page (I am a teacher who uses scholastic, but am ordering for my son as a parent order), but it currently shows the coupon code right on top of the page saying that it is still valid for the free $5 book. Any reason why it isn’t working for me or is a way to fix this? Thank you!",
Neutral,Love it!,
Disappointed,Can't open the flyers to view,
Neutral,I was unable to enter my edited information for the site.  I have changed positions and it did not allow me to enter grade level and number of students.,
Satisfied,"One thing I struggle with is lists.  I often add items to my cart and they disappear when no longer available.  I would love an option to be able to place saved titles in an area.  Sometimes, they are for a particular student.  Sometimes, I want to ensure completing a collection.  Either way, being able to store 1 to 10 lists and titles would be amazing (and if they are no longer available, I would prefer that to be bold and noted alongside the book, but not removed)!",
Very Satisfied,I'm a second grade teacher and love the ease of the website!,
Very Disappointed,I cannot place my order!!!!  $118 of books that it will not let me order.  The teacher code has been given to someone else!  DISASTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
Very Satisfied,Scholastic is a great company!,
Very Satisfied,Why don't you offer the actual flyer anymore?,
Very Satisfied,I think I confirmed the student order but am not sure.,
Neutral,Bumemd that one of the series we wanted was sold out,
Satisfied,"Last year extreme delay in shipping orders (supply chain issues, Backlogs and whatever) from September made us unwilling to submit additional orders throughout the year.  This was very disappointing.  We'd like to try again this year. We are hopeful we won't have the same issues.",
Satisfied,It would be awesome to buy books to keep at home.,
Satisfied,"It took me a little while to figure out how to search by reading level. If that were more obvious, shopping on this site would be less frustrating . I also which there were more options for lower grade levels from the classics, like Usborne's illustrated stories (Shakespeare, Dickens, Greek Myths, etc.)",
Very Satisfied,much easier than filling out a form,
Very Satisfied,This was my first time switching between ordering as a parent and teacher and it was super easy! Thank you!!,
Neutral,Still waiting for a refund from an order I returned in April.  I only received half of the refund I am owed.,
Satisfied,"Is there a way to send an email, that parents submitted online orders?",
Satisfied,The new way you have the system set up does not allow to easily click books for points. It is frustrating.,
Very Satisfied,send early childhood catalogs,
Very Disappointed,"I am a teacher and want to buy for my classroom!  I've purchased as a parent before, now I am a teacher.",

Very Satisfied,My experience with Scholastic has always been amazing!!  I am a huge reading advocate and want my little ones to appreciate and love reading as well!,
Very Satisfied,A wonderful program to interest young people to learn to love reading!!!!,
Satisfied,"The site only kind of works on mobile... I was visting the site on my iphone 13 using Safari and could search and add books to my cart, but when I went to use the READS promo code and select a free $5 book, I couldn't confirm and submit my selection, the page froze. So I had to complete my order on my laptop (which worked fine)",
Very Satisfied,Not ready to announce the book order to my class.,
Very Satisfied,I enjoy having this for my families and being able to purchase things for my classroom as well.,
Neutral,On the list of free book options it is difficult to read the longer titles.  It is cut off.  Otherwise everything is very user friendly.,
Very Satisfied,I love Scholastic book Clubs!  Great books at reasonable prices!,
Satisfied,hard to access where i can use my points and dollar rewards,
Very Satisfied,i love white fox,
Very Satisfied,So helpful and easy for everyone to use,
Very Satisfied,"I love how user friendly this site has become over the years.  The simple step of adding the names to the individual orders makes distribution so much easier.  My only suggestion would be to add some $1.00 books for options when we have ""money to spend"" so we can help build classroom sets for our students without bearing the cost burden ourselves.  Otherwise, thanks so much!",
Satisfied,Difficult to find where to enter the teacher/class code.,
Very Satisfied,easy to order and navigate the site,
Neutral,"It would be helpful to see if my child's teacher had a wishlist or any books that she wanted for the classroom. Even if her teacher didn't have one and there were 0 items at least as a parent I would be able to see if there was one and could ""donate"" to the classroom in that way.",
Satisfied,"I have been a Scholastic teacher/customer for 26 years. I understand that things are more expensive now however the cost of items and lack of teacher deals is very discouraging. The amount of bonus points charged for books is ridiculous. I have 36 students in my class and like to get at least 6 books per year for them. I cannot afford this out of pocket expense. I hope that Scholastic takes this into consideration as I know many of my colleagues feel as I do and cannot afford to continue purchasing books. Also, I work in a poverty coded school and most of our parents cannot purchase books unless they are extremely discounted. I love Scholastic and am trying to continue our relationship however am more  discouraged each year based on lack of teacher deals and bonus point increases.",
Very Satisfied,I love using the site to get books ..,
Very Satisfied,Please keep monthly flyers coming to my school. People still prefer to look at a paper flyer.,
Very Satisfied,You wanted me to take the survey AFTER I finished placing my order but it popped up right away.  I had barely started the order.  Most of your questions relate to me having PLACED the order when I hadn't had the chance to do so yet.,
Disappointed,"I am extremely disappointed that as a teacher I was NOT allowed to use my bonus points to purchase books from the dollar section. I have always ordered one book per child for my classroom. Your book prices have gone up and teachers can no longer afford to purchase with bonus points books for her classroom. I submitted a huge order, but I will definitely rethink if I will submit next month, sorry!",
Satisfied,It is disappointing that we can only shop from the dollar book inventory with a class order of $75 or more.,
Very Satisfied,It was very easy.  I could see the flier and make my selections very easily.,
Disappointed,Hard site to navigate.  If I didn’t know the name of the book I was looking for I wouldn’t have the patience to find it.  The search option was useful.,
Satisfied,I sent an email to request flyers. It would be nice to have an online option  to request flyers.,
Satisfied,"I really appreciate the Teacher Bonus Catalog and use my reward points to purchase items for our classroom.  However, I would like you to offer more puzzles for pre-k students.   Years ago I purchased  a ""No, David!"" puzzle through Scholastic.  I read the book ""No, David!"" by David Shannon to my class and then my students love putting this 28 piece puzzle together.  The puzzles do not necessarily have to be book related, but just sturdy and good quality.  I also miss selecting from Melissa & Doug products.",

Very Satisfied,Smooth as always,
Neutral,We already have many of the books on your site and the others just don't interest me.,
Neutral,The entire process was very easy.,
Neutral,"Many pop ups confused me, and the most common reason to come to the website is to place an order which was just plain hard to find quickly.",
Satisfied,"Selection is good, ordering is a little confusing having two different sites with scholastic.com and the bookclub site.  I couldn't find the books from the school flyer at first. The chat feature is very nice. Thanks",
Disappointed,I was not able to select the free book that I was eligible for due to glitches on your website. I attempted multiple times but the webpage froze.,
Very Satisfied,STILL WAITING FOR MORE STUDENTS TO TURN IN ORDERS BY 9-16,

Very Satisfied,Wonderful and easy.,
Very Satisfied,Wanted to browse the site but will be back to purchase books in the near future.  Thank you for helping teachers out with the book club option.,
Neutral,I wanted to use my own information to order my granddaughter’s books. I wanted to create an account for myself. It would not let me. It only would let my daughter get into her account. Which is aggravating to say the least. I experience a lot of frustration with your website every year.,
Satisfied,I was trying to find something for 2.00 to spend the rest of my 10.00 on - no luck!,
Satisfied,Well laid out,
Very Disappointed,"Every single time I order books form Scholastics for my son's classroom, the coupon reads does not work!  This is extremely frustrating. I chatted  with 2 representatives and there were clueless and couldn't figure out the problem.     This is simply not acceptable.",
Very Satisfied,N/A,
Neutral,"I wasn't able to easily put in the exact reading levels of books that I wanted to search for, it kept taking me to a much broader range than I wanted initially. I'm not able to share my book list with family members, and I have multiple people that would like to place orders. Will eventually place an order, just need to manually deconflict with family on which books everyone wil purchase so we don't duplicate.",
Satisfied,hard to get back to my same spot after adding a book to cart,
Neutral,"The site doesn't preview the flyers well. The actual place to view the flyers is great, but the page to preview them doesn't show enough information to be useful in identifying which flyer is best.",
Very Satisfied,It is fun,
Neutral,"There are books in the 3rd grade flyer that say they have ""mature content""--they should not be in the flyer at all. Particularly, one called ""The Language of Seabirds"" that pictures two teen boys on the cover. The topic of romance in any form is inappropriate content for third graders...let alone same-sex romance material. It's disappointing to see this kind of content being pushed on young children.",
Very Satisfied,Good choices and easy to navigate the site. Prices are good as well.,
Neutral,It was very easy and quick.,
Very Satisfied,Waiting to let my other kids pick out some books to add to the cart,

Very Satisfied,i had no problems during my visit to this site.,
Very Disappointed,I tried but it kept asking for my password  why can’t I just put in the teachers activation code  Old people like me aren’t good at navigating obscure stes,
Neutral,"There is another scholastic site that is confusing and I end up there filling a cart and find out it is not this area and get frustrated. also, when a student gives me a check for a book order and it is under $25 I want to submit it , but I won't from now on because you charge me a shipping fee even if I have an online order. I am about done trying to figure your site out. I don't like to tell students no, but I am not paying shipping because there is not a big enough order.",
Very Satisfied,Love being able to search the actual flyers. So easy and convenient,
Satisfied,"Hoping that Scholastic has a better response time for orders this year.  Last year, I quit ordering because it was embarrassingly long until delivery once orders were submitted. I'm willing to try one more time before I tell parents to just buy books from Amazon.",
Very Satisfied,Easy to use,
Very Satisfied,I love Scholastic!,
Satisfied,"It  usually takes some time for me to navigate this site to get all of what I need i.e. bonus, my order, use money in my account.",

Neutral,"My daughter is entered twice, so what should have been one order ended up being recorded a two.",
Very Satisfied,It would be nice if we had the option to change the signature on emails sent out. I go by Miss Amy instead of Mrs. Nogar and don't see a way to change it.,
Neutral,"I don't feel that your selection meets my needs as it once did. There are no inspirational books and that makes me feel unheard, unseen, and ignored.",
Neutral,I would love to see a teacher wishlist on the site after we are connected to our child's classroom.   We could purchase books for the classroom with our monthly orders and it would make it an easy way to show some support for our teachers.,
Very Satisfied,Last year we barely ordered due to shipping delays. I hope this year everything is back to normal with ordering and shipments.,
Very Satisfied,Like how you have it arranged and is easy to navigate.,
Disappointed,"Not able to order for any of my grandkids at their school today, none of their 3 teachers r on their school website. I don't have their paper in front of me. So not sure how to do it. Kind of frustrating . It asks for emails of teachers, I don't have those either. So as a grandparent, how r we supposed to that when our grandchildren say , hey can u buy us books!!!",
Neutral,I don't like having to sign in so often the site doesn't remember my login over the school year.  Book selection also need more traditional classics from US and the rest of the world.,
Very Satisfied,Always great to work with,
Satisfied,n/a,
Disappointed,"First it site won't recognize my email, so I lost all my points from last year (even though I have the same email for the past 17 years and I used the orders last year). It is difficult to navigate around and find the things you need to find. Also,  I have set  a due date, yet site states I need to set a due date. Frustrating that it is not updating/remember things.",
Satisfied,"When using the $5 code, would be great to just see a list of books that are available vs having the search.",
Disappointed,I wasn't able to access the tab of Introduce a Teacher,
Very Satisfied,I enjoy looking for books for my child on this site.  It's very easy!,
Satisfied,"While looking at flyers online, I had difficulty accessing the arrow in order to flip to the next page. Sometimes it was accessible to me, and other times it wasn't",
Neutral,my gift cards would not work with the packs or books that i am ordering,
Very Satisfied,Everything went fine.,
Very Satisfied,Waiting for day's end to submit.,
Neutral,"In general, I feel its hard to get a full list of available books. I keep clicking around and seeing the same 10 books. I want to see more than that -- I know there is more available. If my daughter wasn't so excited to get books and this didn't support her teacher, I would just purchase from Target or Amazon.",
Satisfied,"When I first logged on, I did not automatically go to the bookclub and had some difficulty beginning the search for my child's books.  Once, I entered /bookclub directly in the web address bar, it made searching for the books easy.",
Neutral,"It's very hard to search.  I can never get search results that match what I am looking for. The flyers and the website are not organized well at all. The flyers are still the same as they were when I was in elementary school 35 years ago. The website is difficult to search considering it is 2022.  It should be much easier to search for what I am looking for. I wanted to find easy reader/I Can Read books for level 1. Not a set, individual books. I couldn't find them.",
Very Satisfied,I love scholastic. I miss the big books.  My mother use to go to book fairs and buy from the door-to-door salesman.,
Satisfied,"no issues, easy search feature, lots of options, definitely will visit again for my 7 year old...",
Disappointed,"I have been having difficulties tracking down a watch that I ordered with bonus points.  I received the 2 other items from the outside vendor by August 16th but still waiting on the watch.  I was only staying in a temporary home for just over a month but have now moved to my new home in Florida.  My husband has stayed behind for almost 2 weeks waiting for the watch to arrive but he needs to drive down to Florida today.  I have called 3 different times, the first time was to see if it hadn't been shipped if I could change the address to Florida home, the 2nd time was to see if they had responded on address change (they hadn't) she sent another email and said they would contact me (they haven't) today she sent for a tracking number since it's been over 4 weeks now.  I am waiting to hear back once more, hopefully this time I will hear from someone finally.",
Neutral,"I had not used Scholastic Book Clubs in the past few years due to the delay in receiving books and price increases as a result of the Covid pandemic.  I would like to try ordering again with this year's class.  I have not received any paper copies and would like to send those home, but cannot find out how to get those sent to me.",
Satisfied,"A suggestion for the website layout, is to add quick add instead of actually clicking on the book.  Just takes a little longer.  )",
Very Satisfied,I love ordering from Scholastic news you make it easy.,
Very Disappointed,"It is sad that we have to spend a certain amount to get access to the $1 books. As a teacher, we would be able to spend so much more money on books if we had access to the $1 books. I have parents/friends that want to support my classroom and it went from $20 a month to $40 a month if we can even find a decent book for $2. This makes me sad, because for what it would cost me for a whole year, now I can only hope I can get 6 months worth. But if I only find a $3 book @ 21 students, that allows me 2 months worth of books. It makes me not want to use your site to purchase books anymore.",
Very Satisfied,"Not really a difficulty but I added the book I'd be using for my ""free"" book when I used the code READS. But after using the code, you can't select a book already in your cart and you have to enter a the book again and then go back and delete the one you already had in there. Again, not a big deal but it would be nice if when you enter a code, it let you apply it to something already in your cart.",
Very Disappointed,"Please withdraw me from your mailing list,  email,  and do not send any more flyers to me.  I have used Scholastic for many years and have recently noticed the change from good book offerings to children to too many political, and WOKE offerings. I  am not interested in supporting Scholastic any longer.   C  Tabor  Kindergarten   Madison Elementary  1436 W 300 N  Warsaw, IN  4582-6335",
Neutral,"While you all really have the classroom book club process down and are very friendly for teachers, I'm still not pleased with the ratio of high-quality and classic literature to more solely fun and silly books that are written as more of a cartoon dialogue.  The prevalence of teachers using Scholastic at my new school and the slightly more balanced selections on the most recent flyers has prompted me to come cook at reviving my account, though.  We'll see!  I'm not just a straight-laced teacher who doesn't want kids to have fun.  I want to keep them open to the historical body of literature and to help them develop their language skills.  The students I teach are not hard to pair with books.  They love them!",
Very Satisfied,It was great and so easy to add my kids.,
Satisfied,"I got an email about a Goosebump author visit contest and wanted to sign up. Once I sign into Scholastic, I can't find where to sign up for the contest. Please advice. My class would love to win this!",
Very Satisfied,"Could not find my childs teacher, but used a different teacher",
Very Satisfied,I tried to enter the R.L.Stine contest and it says that I do not have permission from you to do so....  Please let me know when it is fixed.,
Neutral,Everything went very well!,
Satisfied,I set up my teacher account,
Very Satisfied,This site was really easy to use,
Satisfied,none,
Very Satisfied,I made this payment and it still shows I owe.,
Satisfied,"I didn't understand the difference between ordering on the site and ordering through the book club, but I figured it out.",
Very Satisfied,"Placing a book order was very easy.  The website is very easy to look through, prices were well priced.",
Satisfied,"The selection was a little underwhelming. Im shopping for 5 years old and under. Looking for educational or with good stories. At a glance, many of the books did not appeal to what im looking for for my kids. The illustrations were too abstract and the characters seemed kinda obscure. I saw Berenstain Bears and may return to buy some of those. But overall i thought the selections seemed weak.",
Satisfied,There were many books we were looking to our collection that are not on site.  Would like to see more Rick Riordan choices.   Would rather shop under school account than go to a book store or order on amazon.,
Satisfied,"Some of the search features didnt seem to work quite as hoped, but I was able to nagivate around and find the books I was looking for.",
Very Satisfied,Really enjoy the fact that I can do orders for the classroom,
Neutral,"hard to find books, all together in one place.",
Satisfied,Had to reset my password but it was easily done. Have not placed any orders in a long time due to Covid.,
Neutral,"Unfortunately, I need to be able order books to be shipped directly to our home as our last order got sent home on a day our daughter went to her biological mothers home. We never saw the books and they were immediately posted for re-sale on social media. Was hoping to be able to support the school and her classroom by placing an order and having it shipped directly to my home. I was advised at this time, that feature is not offered. I love scholastic program, the reading levels are very clear for shopping and books are always age appropriate. Would still recommend for civil families. In the meantime, I just have to continue to shop elsewhere.",
Neutral,"Should be easier or have a prompt to connect to classroom teacher,  and assigning books to child.",
Neutral,bummer there is a minimum for no shipping.,
Neutral,the website teacher gave us (scholastic.com/readingclub) did not work.,
Very Satisfied,"At first, when I logged in, I couldn't quite find the place where I needed to select  his teacher for this year.  After a little searching around, I found it.",
Very Satisfied,Well done!,
Satisfied,It would be nice when entering the item number to preview it is what I am looking for before adding to the cart.,
Neutral,I can’t checkout at all.,
Very Satisfied,"Very well organized, easy to navigate--I appreciate being able to look through the paper catalog with my daughter to select items. Then I can just enter the number on the site--very convenient.",
Neutral,"There used to be some great options for letters to parents that you could edit and print off. You used to be able to change the header to those letters as well. I like having a paper copy of the first letter sent home. The option you have now does not offer any good wording to encourage parents to look through the flyers or even the website to find great literature for their children. Fortunately I have saved copies from previous years, but what about new teachers that don't have that? I find that very disappointing. I think you should be offering a monthly parent letter that could be attached to the book orders each month to encourage the parents to take a look at the month's offerings along with why they should order from your company.",
Satisfied,"I haven't submitted my order because the due date is tomorrow, other than that everything was  fine!",
Satisfied,"After placing a book in the cart and I choose continue shopping, it doesn't take me back to where I was browsing before.",
Neutral,"It was not clear what the codes for reading levels mean, and it was not easy to find a glossary. Once I found a glossary, I still wasn't entirely sure I understood what they meant? There were A LOT of different types of codes.",
Neutral,I wish it was more easily accessible to find books by reading level and not grade level. I eventually figured it out but there wasn’t an immediate section on the website.,
Very Satisfied,Website is easy to navigate!,
Very Satisfied,"Hoping to find that you're bringing back the warehouse sales to Clinton, MA!!",
Very Satisfied,Great site,
Satisfied,No issues today.,
Very Satisfied,I use to be able to ship to my house now I do not have that option which limits me ordering books for the holidays  I would like to support the classroom but do not want them to see them early   I would love to still be able to ship them to the house,
Neutral,Trouble searching in the 5 dollar book bin and trouble adding my child's teacher until I figured out the right city to search for.,
Satisfied,I miss the books for $1.,
Neutral,"This user interface is very easy to use when you have the flyer in hand. I like that you still send the paper flyer home with my child. It reminds me of ordering from Scholastic when I was a child but without having to write a check or send cash... literally, a perfect process. Thank you!",
Very Disappointed,Messed up book order and very long wait time to correct it.,
Satisfied,"I went to the wrong site, added a bunch of books to the cart before I realized I could not find a way to add the code from my child's class.  (https://shop.scholastic.com) I spent a long time looking for ""Find your Child's Teacher"" before I decided to check the site address on the class handout. Please add a link in the footer/header that would take parents to the right site. If I hadn't figured it out, I would not have made the order.",
Very Satisfied,I entered another teacher's email into the place where you recommend a teacher.  Then the teacher signed up.  I was checking to see if I received my 250 bonus points.  I couldn't find any added bonus points on my account for getting a new teacher to sign up.,
Neutral,"I called several weeks ago to request catalogs so they would be in my room ready for back to school night, I have not received them. Other teachers in my building have. I am new which is why I called to make sure they were there. I really hope they will be expidiated.",
Very Disappointed,This site is very difficult to use. All I want to do is order a book using bonus points . I want this book early October,
Very Satisfied,Hoping shipping is better than last year!!!,
Satisfied,I wish AR levels were displayed without having to search or click on the book title.,
Satisfied,I wish I could filter by price!,
Very Satisfied,Everything went smoothly.,
Satisfied,It is hard to get my parents to order books.  I did one order last year and then no one ordered again! I'm hoping to get the kids and parents excited to order books!  We  do have an awesome book fair every year with Scholastic.,
Very Satisfied,Great site! Super easy to use and can donate also! Thumbs up!!,
Neutral,none,
Satisfied,"I like the simplicity of finding items and I like that delivery to the school is free.  There used to be a discount by placing an order online.  That is gone and it made me a little sad.  Gratefully, we got a free $5 book for spending $25.",
Satisfied,"Worrying about how long orders will take this year.  Submitted one, shipped in 4 days (YAY!).  Submitted a second, still pending 6 days later.  That' not terrible, but I'm afraid of what happened in the past couple of years - orders taking weeks/months to arrive (we just quit ordering).  Fingers crossed!",
Satisfied,"As long as there isnt a huge delay in the shipping time like last year, I will be a happy customer.",
Very Satisfied,I always enjoy shopping for books but I'm not the parent--I'm one of the grandparents.,
Very Satisfied,Love to encourage my kids to read and you have a good selection of books.,
Very Satisfied,The site wants me to have the books delivered to the elementary school. I need to confer with the librarian on getting the books without my daughters seeing them as I would like to give them as gifts.,
Satisfied,I will be purchasing but just visited for the first time today.,
Neutral,Would be nice on the home page to go straight to order through my school tab,
Satisfied,"One thing I will mention is that in looking up information for both this and the book fair sales, it would be really nice to actually talk to someone.  For instance, I've heard things that make me hesitant to host a book fair.   I'd love to talk to someone, but I've not been able to figure out how.",
Satisfied,"I find the selection limited.  I ordered the first Harry Potter book, but there is not a second, to order later on, unless I get it in a box set.",
Very Satisfied,Love that we are able to add the student's name now!,
Very Satisfied,it did not let me put the code # in had to find school,
Neutral,Looking for more books. Would like a bigger selection to choose from,
Satisfied,Last year I had a lot of difficulty with my order and it taking so long to be delivered.  I am glad to hear that things will be better.,
Very Satisfied,Hoping things are back to normal and quick this year!,
Very Disappointed,"unable to send the digital flyer.  The link says it is copied, but it will not work in SeeSaw",
Satisfied,Just updating information.,
Very Satisfied,"I love these prices, so wonderful to have a resource for affordable books for my kiddo!",
Neutral,It was hard to enter online orders. I did not know what to do. I had to chat with someone to figure out to click on my cart.,
Satisfied,finding where to put in teachers info,
Disappointed,Your website is very hard to maneuver through. It is hard to get back to where you were if you want to continue shopping.,
Very Satisfied,I called in to the phone number to ask some questions and the representative was so helpful. I love ordering scholastic books for my students! :),
Satisfied,it takes a bit to load,
Very Satisfied,I was only on briefly but did not easily see where/how to navigate between the different flyers that my child brought home. I was only able to quickly and easily access the one that I ordered from which happened to have the item that she wanted.,
Very Satisfied,keep up the great work!,
Satisfied,My first time visiting the site and I am having some difficulty find things.,
Very Satisfied,"I'm looking to enable alerts when a parent submits an order, possibly to get sent to my email.  I'll keep looking, but that would be a helpful feature to add if it doesn't exist.  Thank you!",
Very Disappointed,You NEED to have books for one dollar.  LOTS of teachers purchase their own books.,
Satisfied,"No difficulties, I don't think I'm looking at it correct, because I don't feel like I'm seeing all the books offered on this website. When I search a specific book, I find it, but just browsing it's hard to see everything offered.",
Neutral,Missing the physical flyers,
Satisfied,I had trouble determining how include free book info.I eventually got there but it wasn't clear to me,
Neutral,Layout of home page is confusing smallest botton was order here and lead to search engine with inflated prices...lots of extra resources and info up front but  we're here to buy books. Like the flyer feature but could of been easier to find...had to click more than a few times to find what I wanted.,
Very Satisfied,I love Scholastic and so do my parents.,
Disappointed,love books,
Satisfied,Some of the numbers that I entered did not produce the books I was looking for.  Had to type in titles.,
Very Satisfied,I am seeking free books for my Title 1 School's Counseling Library. We are just starting up from ground zero.,

Satisfied,"The code READS would not work at first, after logging out and back in, it worked.",
Very Satisfied,Great website and I love ordering from Scholastic books as a kid.,
Neutral,Need larger variety of books.,
Satisfied,slow to move from one flyer to the next,
Neutral,You just didn't offer the Title I was looking to purchase.,
Very Satisfied,Everything was very easy to order.,
Neutral,"I made a cart last night, planned on adding to it today, and I am logged out. When I try to log in, it scrolls and doesn't connect. Guessing something is not calling for information correctly.",
Very Satisfied,I wish there was a way to easily understand the different flyers there are for each age group.,
Neutral,it was not easy to add the school code - there should be a separate section for it at checkout near a promo code area.,
Satisfied,I would like to be able to send digital flyers via Parent Square and I am not sure how to do that.,
Very Satisfied,great!,
Neutral,Great idea,
Satisfied,I like being able to recommend books for parents.  I get asked that question SO many times.  The class wishlist is nice too.,
Neutral,Had to reset password - not a big deal.,
Satisfied,"Great experience. Easy to use  and fairly painless to search  for , filter, and find books. No complaints. Just note that I usually don't give maximum scores in my reviews if you're questioning why I rated 4 & 9.",
Very Satisfied,Easy to use site.  Love Scholastic!,
Very Satisfied,"This is my first time utilizing the website for book purchase. Usually, we are only given a paper copy. Which it is very hard to to see and order from time to time. This has been a great experience and would highly recommend.    I do have a recommendation for some books that would be awesome Paul Goble's Native American books.     Thank you for the convenience of the online ordering.",
Very Satisfied,Wonderful RESOURCE for teachers!!,
Satisfied,"My child goes to school in Wellington, Texas and the code that was given to her was for her teacher but the address was in Silverton, Texas.",
Very Satisfied,The site is very easy to navigate. I appreciate the ease of submitting an order.,
Very Satisfied,I just signed up.  I am a new teacher.  I look forward to buying books for my classroom.,
Neutral,"Wish there was a bigger variety. Prices were more expensive than even B&N, unless I got a bundle.",
Neutral,"I am disappointed at the number of items that are only available to purchase with money. As a teacher who spend their own money to buy cleaning supplies and more, I had always looked to Scholastic for buying books as gifts and supplies with bonus points.  I feel Scholastic isn't recognizing the time it takes for teachers to do the work in promoting your business. I also was offended by the term ""inflation buster."" You should be giving deals with a message that is supporting Back to School and nothing that can be perceived as being political.",
Very Satisfied,I love Scholastic and how they give teachers so many chances to earn bonus points or money to spend immediately.,
Neutral,"It only wanted me to like the books, also the pages were uncooperative in turning and I sizing.  The book selection is not what I expected. I was looking for more Caldecott or Newberry award books.",
Neutral,Need to find out password. It is saved on my computer but not sure what it is.,
